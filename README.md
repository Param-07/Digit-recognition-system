# Handwritten Digit Recognition System using MNIST Dataset

# Overview

This project aims to develop a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits widely used for training various image processing systems.

The system employs machine learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits accurately. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn features from the input images and classify them into respective digit classes.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) design, which is widely used for image classification tasks. The CNN architecture comprises multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

The CNN architecture used in this project is as follows:

1. **Input Layer:** Accepts input images of size 28x28 pixels.
2. **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the input images using convolutional filters.
3. **Pooling Layers:** Downsample the feature maps to reduce dimensionality and extract dominant features.
4. **Flattening Layer:** Flatten the feature maps into a single vector.
5. **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification based on the extracted features.

## Training

The model is trained using the training set of the MNIST dataset. During training, the model learns to classify handwritten digits by adjusting its parameters to minimize the classification error. The training process involves forward propagation, backward propagation (gradient descent), and optimization of the model parameters.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using the testing set of the MNIST dataset to assess its performance on unseen data. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which measure the model's ability to correctly classify digits.

## Usage

To use the handwritten digit recognition system:

1. Install the necessary dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Train the model using the training script (`train.py`) with the MNIST dataset.
3. Evaluate the trained model using the testing script (`test.py`) with the MNIST dataset.
4. Deploy the model for real-time digit recognition in applications.
